About the game:
This game has a menu that lets the user choose between player vs player and computer vs player.
You can choose to play again or exit at any time.
It also shows the scoreboard of the players and computers.
This is my first game and program made in python that I am releasing publicly.
This is my first step in learning python to do automation tasks that are boring to do or something you have to do regulary to save your time.
